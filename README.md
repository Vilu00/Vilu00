### Hi there! I'm Viola 👋

I am a **PhD student in Pure Mathematics** at the University of Padova, Italy.

My research lies in **Algebra**, and I am currently working on understanding specific algebraic structures arising from surfaces; a topic I find truly fascinating since it blends together different areas of mathematics such as combinatorics, geometry and algebra ✨. 

While I am a pure mathematician at heart, I am very curious about **programming** 💻.  In particular I am currently learning how to integrate software development and AI 🤖 into my research, and I'm excited to learn and contribute to this community here.  

#### Beyond the Desk 🧁

When I'm not in my office or at my desk doing math, you can usually find me **running** 🏃‍♀️, **baking cakes** 🎂, or hanging out with friends 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.

Although I am currently based in Padova, I am originally from **Parma** 🧀, the city famous for its Parmesan cheese and prosciutto, which explains my great appreciation for good food 🍝.

Feel free to reach out 🤝, especially if you have interesting project ideas that blend mathematics and programming!
